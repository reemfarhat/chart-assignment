    <p>The nonprofit Doe Fund’s initiative, called Ready, Willing and Able, is reducing recidivism rates in formerly incarcerated and formerly homeless New Yorkers through employment opportunities. </p>
    
    <p>In September 2021 the Department of Justice report on recidivism in 24 states including New York found that about 61% of prisoners released in 2008 returned to prison within a 10 year period. </p>

    </script>
    

    <p>“​For individuals being released from both jails and prisons, the recidivism rate is extremely high,” said Jeff Mellow, recidivism expert and professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. </p>
    
    <p>Mellows said that while short term employment programs have temporarily reduced recidivism, they must be supplemented with long term support to retain the changes. Along with employment, age is a factor that reduces recidivism because most people age out of criminal activity, which he said accounts for the fact that recidivism rates decrease the more years pass since incarceration. </p>
